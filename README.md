## How this Program Works

This is the Current Stock of the Bamazon MySQL 'Warehouse'

![Stock] (/images/initialStock.PNG?raw=true "Initial Stock")

1. Run the BamazonCustomer.js file in Git Bash
![Run File] (/images/run.PNG?raw=true "Run file")
2. You will see the item ID, name and price listed
![List of items] (/images/list.PNG?raw=true "list")
3. You will then be prompted to enter the item ID of the item you want and the amount of them you want
![number of items] (/images/number.PNG?raw=true "user input")
4. If there are not enough items in stock, you will receive a warning
![warning] (/images/notenough.PNG?raw=true "Warning")
5. If there are enough items in stock, you will receive the total price of your order and the Bamazon MySQL 'Warehouse' listing will update
![final stock] (/images/finalStock.PNG?raw=true "Final Stock")
