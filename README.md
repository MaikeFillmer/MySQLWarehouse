## How this Program Works

This is the Current Stock of the Bamazon MySQL 'Warehouse'

1. Run the BamazonCustomer.js file in Git Bash

2. You will see the item ID, name and price listed

3. You will then be prompted to enter the item ID of the item you want and the amount of them you want

4. If there are not enough items in stock, you will receive a warning

5. If there are enough items in stock, you will receive the total price of your order and the Bamazon MySQL 'Warehouse' listing will update
